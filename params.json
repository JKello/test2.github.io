It's called study \r\nroom menager and it will organize in a smart way the places in the study room, and why not try to make the students \r\nmore considerate toward the others. actually by creating an organized environment means also a calm environment, meaning\r\na better environment to study. so the result is not just happier students, because they are efficiently are using their \r\ntime to study, without loosing time to find a place, but also school administration since the facilities are properly\r\nused by the people who really need it. \r\n\r\nwhat the system does is:\r\n\r\nIt  reserves the place in advance. Each student is assigned one place if available otherwise they are put on a “waiting list”.(this way the problem of one student occupying more than one place is resolved.)\r\n\r\nFor the occupied places recognize if they are properly used or not, meaning if student occupying the place just left it's things and went away.  In this case notify the student that his \"study session\" is ending(if he was away for too long).\r\nAlso notifies the student on the top of the “waiting list”. Every change should be displayed to better explain the situation for the other students in line.\r\n\r\nThe system tries to exploit also the idea of students leaving the place free for a certain amount of time to reclaim it back later.(recognize the student if he comes back or continue the \"study session\" with the already seated one).\r\nIn a certain way students become more understanding. Since they won’t use that service for some time they allow someone else to have it. In this way the study time is efficiently managed!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

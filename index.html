<p>study room or occupied room? the usual situation in a study room is all the places occupied with notebooks but 
there is no body there. you come back after one hour and you find again the same situation wandering if somebody is
doing you a joke! what happens is that some students occupy more than one place, usually for their lazy friends who will
turn up not before the afternoon! or the student occupied the place and went to a lecture that he has and will not finish
before 3 hours have passed! in the meantime the study room become this crowded place with students which will pass by and 
usually ask if the places are occupied or not, making noise and disturbing the others which are desperately trying to 
study for their exams. summing up all these the effect is that the study room somehow loses it's effectivity, it's 
meaning.</p>

<p>So for all the students(those who want to spend their time effitiently studing) here is the solution! It's called study 
room menager and it will organize in a smart way the places in the study room, and why not try to make the students 
more considerate toward the others. actually by creating an organized environment means also a calm environment, meaning
a better environment to study. so the result is not just happier students, because they are efficiently are using their 
time to study, without loosing time to find a place, but also school administration since the facilities are properly
used by the people who really need it. </p>

<p>what the system does is:</p>

<p>It  reserves the place in advance. Each student is assigned one place if available otherwise they are put on a “waiting list”.(this way the problem of one student occupying more than one place is resolved.)</p>

<p>For the occupied places recognize if they are properly used or not, meaning if student occupying the place just left it's things and went away.  In this case notify the student that his "study session" is ending(if he was away for too long).
Also notifies the student on the top of the “waiting list”. Every change should be displayed to better explain the situation for the other students in line.</p>

<p>The system tries to exploit also the idea of students leaving the place free for a certain amount of time to reclaim it back later.(recognize the student if he comes back or continue the "study session" with the already seated one).
In a certain way students become more understanding. Since they won’t use that service for some time they allow someone else to have it. In this way the study time is efficiently managed!</p>
